# CONTROL_ROBOT_ARM
This code controls a 6-degree-of-freedom robotic arm using servo motors and an Arduino Uno. It reads input from a joystick or potentiometers and moves each servo accordingly. The code ensures smooth and precise motion for automation tasks like pick-and-place operations.  ðŸš€ Simple, efficient, and great for learning robotics!
